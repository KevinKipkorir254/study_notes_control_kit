# DATA PRE-PROCESSING

When the data have been collected from the identification experiment, they are not
likely to be in shape for immediate use in identification algorithms. There are several
possible deficiencies in the data that should be attended to:
1. High-frequency disturbances in the data record, above the frequencies of interest
   to the system dynamics
2. Occasional bursts and outliers, missing data, non-continuous data records
3. Drift and offset, low-frequency disturbances, possibly of periodic character

It must be stressed that in off-line applications, one should always first plot the data
in order to inspect them for these deficiencies. In this section we shall discuss how
to preprocess the data so as to avoid problems in the identification procedures later.

## DRIFTS AND DETRENDING

Low-frequency disturbances, offsets, trends, drift, and periodic (seasonal) variations
are not uncommon in data. They typically stem from external sources that we may
or may not prefer to include in the modeling. There are basically two different
approaches to dealing with such problems:
 1. Removing the disturbances by explicit pretreatment of the data
 2. Letting the noise model take care of the disturbances

The first approach involves removing trends and offsets by direct subtraction,
while the second relies on noise models with poles on or close to the unit circle,
like the ARIMA models much used in the Box and Jenkins approach.

### Signal offsets

We shall illustrate the two approaches applied to the offset problem. The standard
linear models that we use. like,

$$A(q)y(t) = B(q)u(t) + v(t)$$ --------------------- 1

describe the relationship between it u and y. There are at least six ways to deal with
this problem:

1. Let $$y(t)$$ and $$u(t)$$ be deviations from a physical equilibrium: 
The most natural approach is to determine the level $$\bar{y}$$ that corresponds to a constant $$u_m(t) = \bar{u}$$ close to the desired operating point. Then define

$$y(t) = y_m(t) - \bar{y}$$

$$u(t) = u_m(t) - \bar{u}$$

as the deviations from this equilibrium. These translated variables will automatically satisfy (14.2), making both members equal to zero, and (2) will thus not influence the fit in (1). This approach emphasizes the physical interpretation of (1) as a linearization around the equilibrium.

2. Subracting sample means: A sound approach is to define

$$\bar{u} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N u_m(t)$$

$$\bar{y} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N y_m(t)$$

and then use (14.3). If an input $$u_m(t)$$ that varies around $$\bar{u}$$ leads to an output that varies around $$\bar{y}$$, then $$(\bar{u}, \bar{y})$$ is likely to be close to an equilibrium point of the system. Approach 2 is thus closely related to the first approach.

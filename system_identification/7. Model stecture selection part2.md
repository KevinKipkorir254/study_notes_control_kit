# MODEL DEVELOPMENT

This is the primal objective of identification. It consists of three main operations:
1. Selecting a model structure
2. Estimating the chosen model
3. Quality assessment of the model
The goal of modeling is to obtain the most parsimonious model that has the best properties and with the least modeling effort.
Parsimony of the model usually refers to parameter dimensionality. Attractive properties include the usual good predictive ability, high model accuracy and precision, while the modeling effort mainly appeals to the computational complexity of the estimation algorithm. As we have learnt through the theoretical discussions and illustrative examples in this text, these requirements are usually conflicting in nature. The final model is therefore always governed by some trade-offs determined by the application.

## MODEL STRUCTURE SELECTION

Selecting a model structure involves making decisions on:
i. Model type: LTI / LTV / Non-linear, etc.
ii. Domain of modeling: Time, frequency, time-frequency or any other basis space
iii. Model family: ARX, ARMAX, OE, non-linear classes, etc.
iv. Model characteristics: Order and input memory

> Start with a simple model, preferably guided by non-parametric analysis and (possibly some) a priori knowledge, and proceed towards more sophisticated model structures guided by data and model diagnostics.

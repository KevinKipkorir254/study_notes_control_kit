# INPUT DESIGN FOR IDENTIFICATION

An input that meets the practical requirements of a process 
operation is said to be plant friendly, some primary 
considerations are:

- The bias and variance of the estimates depend only on the input
spectrum.
- The input must have limited amplitude taking into account the 
physical constraints of the process operation.
- Periodic inputs may be useful, particularly in modal identification.
- The parameter estimate covariance matrix is typically inversely proportional 
to the input power (variance). Therefore, we would like to inject as much power 
as possible into the input.

Here is a list of the types of inputs that can be used for the system Identification inputs.

## TYPES OF INPUTS

1. White noise - It contains all frequencies uniformly. Theoretically a preferable input signal. Decouples
the IR parameter estimation problem. Provides uniform fit at all frequencies. However,
possesses a high crest factor.

2. Random binary signal - Generated by starting with a Gaussian sequence and then passing it through a
filter depending on the input spectrum requirements. The sign of the filtered signal is the RBS.
No proper control over the spectrum. The “sign” operation distorts the spectrum of the input
sequence. The RBS has the lowest crest factor.

3. Pseudo-random binary signal - As the name suggests, it is not strictly a random signal. It is a deterministic signal with the properties of a random signal. Generated using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) of n bits, a maximum length PRBS is $$2^{n} - 1$$ sequences long. A full-band PRBS possesses white noise-like properties. The frequency content can be changed by altering the clock sampling rate. It has the lowest crest factor. A disadvantage is that only maximum length PRBS possess the desired properties.

4. Multisine - Multisines are a combination of sinusoids of different frequencies, which are generally
known beforehand. These signals provide very good estimates of the transfer function at the respective frequencies. While both amplitudes and phases are design parameters, the latter have a significant influence on the amplitude, and hence the crest factor. A useful guideline is to keep
the sines as much as “out of phase” as possible so as to keep the crest factor low. Note that the
spectrum is not continuous.

Of the above the PRBS sequence is the most widely used for linear systems since binary signals
have the lowest crest factor for a given variance.

## PSEUDO-RANDOM BINARY SEQUENCE

Binary signals with a desired spectral shape can be generated in two ways:
1. Random Binary signal: Generated by passing a random Gaussian signal through a sign function.
The disadvantage is that there is little control over the spectrum
2. Pseudo-Random Binary signal: These are deterministic binary signals that have white noiselike
properties (and hence the name pseudo-random)

    PRBS: $$u[k] = \text{rem}(a_1u[k - 1] + \cdots + a_nu[k - n], 2)$$

    - With n-coefficients, one can generate a $$2^{n} - 1$$ full length sequence
    - The choice of coeFFcients (which are zero / non-zero) determines if a full length or partial
      length sequence is generated.
    - The signal resulting from the modulo operation above switches between 0 and 1. To obtain
      a PRBS that switches between -1 and 1, a linear transformation of the form au + b; a =
      2; b = 􀀀1 is applied.

## FULL-LENGTH PRBS

For a n-coefficient PRBS, the maximum length sequence that can be generated without repetition is
    $$2^{n} - 1$$.

## BAND-LIMITED PRBS

To generate band-limited, for example, low-frequency content PRBS, the full-length sequence is
subjected to a simple operation. First the full-length PRBS is generated, followed by an elongation
or stretching of the constant portions of full-length PRBS, while keeping the overall length fixed.
Technically, the full-length PRBS is re-sampled P times faster than the frequency at which it is generated.
The resulting signal has the same properties as passing the PRBS through a simple moving
average filter of order P.

$$u[k] = \frac{1}{P} (u[k] + u[k - 1] + \cdots + u[k - P])$$

The main idea is that a full-length PRBS sequence, which has a very long period and random-like properties, can be converted into a "band-limited" PRBS. This means the full-length PRBS is subjected to a simple operation that limits its frequency content.
Specifically, the full-length PRBS is re-sampled (or "decimated") at a lower rate, which has the effect of filtering out the higher frequency content. This leaves behind a version of the PRBS that only contains the lower frequency components.
The benefit of this band-limiting process is that the resulting signal has the same overall length as the original PRBS, but a narrower frequency bandwidth. This can be useful in certain applications where you only need the low-frequency characteristics of a PRBS, rather than the full broadband properties.
The technical details are that the band-limited PRBS is generated by taking the original full-length PRBS sequence, and performing a simple moving average filter on it. This filter averages together a fixed number of consecutive PRBS samples, effectively smoothing out the high frequencies.
Some key points about band-limited PRBS:
1. It retains the same random-like statistical properties as the original PRBS, just with a narrower frequency content.
2. It is well-suited for linear systems, but cannot detect nonlinearities like the original broadband PRBS can.
3. Changing the initialization of the PRBS only causes a shift in the resulting band-limited sequence, not a change in its properties.
4. For more complex non-linear systems, there are specialized PRBS variants like Multi-valued PRBS and Amplitude-Modulated PRBS that can be used.

 In summary, band-limiting a PRBS is a way to extract just the low-frequency, wide-sense stationary characteristics of a pseudo-random signal, while maintaining the overall length and statistical behavior. This can be useful in certain system identification and testing applications.

 ## MATLAB IMPLEMENTATION

```matlab
uk = idinput(2047,'prbs',[0 1],[-1 1]); % full -length PRBS
uk = idinput(2555,'prbs',[0 1/5],[-1 1]); % band -limited PRBS 
```

 ## PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION

 ```python
 import numpy as np
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

 # Generate full-length PRBS
 n = 2047  # Number of coefficients
 prbs_full = np.zeros(2**n - 1)
 
 # Generate band-limited PRBS
 P = 5  # Decimation factor
 prbs_bandlimited = np.zeros(2555)
 
 # Fill the arrays with PRBS values
 for i in range(2**n - 1):
     prbs_full[i] = np.random.choice([-1, 1])
 
 for i in range(2555):
     prbs_bandlimited[i] = np.mean(prbs_full[i*P:(i+1)*P])
 
 # Plot the results
 plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
 plt.plot(prbs_full, label='Full-Length PRBS')
 plt.plot(prbs_bandlimited, label='Band-Limited PRBS')
 plt.xlabel('Time')
 plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
 plt.title('PRBS Signals')
 plt.legend()
 plt.show()

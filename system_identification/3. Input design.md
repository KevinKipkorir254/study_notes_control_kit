# INPUT DESIGN FOR IDENTIFICATION

An input that meets the practical requirements of a process 
operation is said to be plant friendly, some primary 
considerations are:

- The bias and variance of the estimates depend only on the input
spectrum.
- The input must have limited amplitude taking into account the 
physical constraints of the process operation.
- Periodic inputs may be useful, particularly in modal identification.
- The parameter estimate covariance matrix is typically inversely proportional 
to the input power (variance). Therefore, we would like to inject as much power 
as possible into the input.

A property that strikes a balance between the amplitude and the variance requirements is the crest
factor,

$$C_r^2 = \frac{\max_t u^2(t)}{\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N u^2(t)}$$

A good signal waveform is one that has a small crest factor. The theoretic lower bound of $$C_{r}$$ is 1, which is achieved for binary symmetric signals.

## TYPES OF INPUTS

1. White noise - It contains all frequencies uniformly. Theoretically a preferable input signal. Decouples
the IR parameter estimation problem. Provides uniform fit at all frequencies. However,
possesses a high crest factor.

2. Random binary signal - Generated by starting with a Gaussian sequence and then passing it through a
filter depending on the input spectrum requirements. The sign of the filtered signal is the RBS.
No proper control over the spectrum. The “sign” operation distorts the spectrum of the input
sequence. The RBS has the lowest crest factor.

3. Pseudo-random binary signal - As the name suggests, it is not strictly a random signal. It is a deterministic signal with the properties of a random signal. Generated using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) of n bits, a maximum length PRBS is $$ 2^n - 1 $$ sequences long. A full-band PRBS possesses white noise-like properties. The frequency content can be changed by altering the clock sampling rate. It has the lowest crest factor. A disadvantage is that only maximum length PRBS possess the desired properties.

4. Multisine - Multisines are a combination of sinusoids of different frequencies, which are generally
known beforehand. These signals provide very good estimates of the transfer function at the respective frequencies. While both amplitudes and phases are design parameters, the latter have a significant influence on the amplitude, and hence the crest factor. A useful guideline is to keep
the sines as much as “out of phase” as possible so as to keep the crest factor low. Note that the
spectrum is not continuous.

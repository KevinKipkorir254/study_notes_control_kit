# INPUT DESIGN FOR IDENTIFICATION

An input that meets the practical requirements of a process 
operation is said to be plant friendly, some primary 
considerations are:

- The bias and variance of the estimates depend only on the input
spectrum.
- The input must have limited amplitude taking into account the 
physical constraints of the process operation.
- Periodic inputs may be useful, particularly in modal identification.
- The parameter estimate covariance matrix is typically inversely proportional 
to the input power (variance). Therefore, we would like to inject as much power 
as possible into the input.

A property that strikes a balance between the amplitude and the variance requirements is the crest
factor,

$$C_r^2 = \frac{\max_t u^2(t)}{\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N u^2(t)}$$

A good signal waveform is one that has a small crest factor. The theoretic lower bound of $$C_{r}$$ is 1, which is achieved for binary symmetric signals.

# MODEL STRUCTURE SELECTION

The choice of an appropriate model structure $$\mathcal{M}$$ is most crucial for a successful identification application. This choice must be based both on an understanding of the identification procedure and on insights and knowledge about the system to be identified.
Once a model structure has been chosen, the identification procedure provides us with a particular model in this structure. This model may be the best available one, but the crucial question is whether it is good enough for the intended purpose. Testing if a given model is appropriate is known as model validation. Such techniques, which are closely related to the choice of model structure, will also be described in this chapter.

## GENERAL ASPECTS OF MODEL STRUCTURE SELECTION

1. To choose the type of model set.
This involves, for example, the selection between:
- Nonlinear and linear models
- Input-output models
- Black-box models
- Physically parametrized state-space models.

2. To choose the size of the model set.
This involves issues like:
- Selecting the order of a state-space model
- Determining the degrees of the polynomials in a model like (4.33)
- Choosing the number of "neurons" in a neural network

It also contains the problem of which variables to include in the model description. We thus have to select $$\mathcal{M}$$ from a given, increasing chain of structures:

$$\mathcal{M}_1 \subset \mathcal{M}_2 \subset \mathcal{M}_3 \subset ...$$

3. To choose the model parameterisation.
When a model set $$\mathcal{M}^*$$ has been decided on (like a state-space model of a given order), it remains to parametrize it, that is, to find a suitable model structure $$\mathcal{M}$$ whose range equals $$\mathcal{M}^*$$.

## TIME-DELAY ESTIMATION

Estimating the input-output delay as accurately as possible is crucial in several applications. In identification, the accuracy of the delay estimate can have a significant impact on the model estimates. It is important therefore to study this problem at a fundamental level. We begin by studying the definition of time delay.

### DEFINITIONS

The true definition of delay is the time interval between the first change in the input and the first (significant) change in the response. It is independent of process dynamics. For continuous-time systems, the delay is continuous-valued. However, in identification of discrete-time models, delays are expressed in samples. Moreover, there exist two definitions of delays (discrete-time), one corresponding to the true one and the other arising out of approximating high-order dynamics.

1. **True delay**: This is the delay present in the actual physical process. The delay is best estimated in a non-parametric manner, i.e., by making as minimal assumptions as possible on process dynamics, (e.g., using impulse or frequency response methods).

2. **Apparent delay**: This is a consequence of approximating high-order processes by low-order-plus-delay models. The original process may even have no delay in it. Therefore, this is generally a model-induced delay and not necessarily equal to the true delay. The delay estimate is naturally tied to the parametric model in use, and is jointly estimated along with the model parameters. Typically an ARX model is used for ease of estimation.

Several methods exist for estimating time delays in linear systems. These techniques can be broadly classified into:
(i) Time domain
(ii) Frequency domain
(iii) Time-frequency domain-based approaches
The focus of this text is only on the first two classes of methods.

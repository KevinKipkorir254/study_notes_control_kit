# INTRODUCTION

## Root Locus Analysis

Root locus analysis is a powerful graphical technique in control theory and stability analysis. It provides insights into how a system's behavior changes as a key parameter (typically a gain) is adjusted.

### Key Concepts

1. **Definition**: Root locus plots the movement of a system's closed-loop poles in the complex s-plane as a function of a variable parameter.

2. **Origin**: Developed by Walter R. Evans in the 1940s, it has become a fundamental tool in classical control theory.

3. **Purpose**: 
   - Assess system stability
   - Visualize the effect of gain changes on system dynamics
   - Aid in controller design and tuning

4. **Representation**: The plot shows how poles (roots of the characteristic equation) move in the complex plane as a parameter varies.

5. **Stability Criterion**: The system's stability can be determined by observing whether the poles remain in the left half of the s-plane.

### Applications

- Feedback control system design
- Gain selection for desired system response
- Analysis of system sensitivity to parameter changes

Root locus analysis bridges the gap between time-domain and frequency-domain techniques, offering valuable insights into system behavior and facilitating effective controller design.

### TRANSFER FUNCTION

We have 2 models for the transfer function of localised regions of a non-linear system. (Probably add a picture of what I mean of add  a seperate readme describing this).

**Continuous-time ARMAX model:** 

$$
A(s)y(t) = B(s)u(t) + C(s)e(t)
$$

- A(s) = s² + 13.87s + 34.91
- B(s) = 0.080631s + 0.7555
- C(s) = s² + 136.4s + 2023

$$
\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{0.7555}{s² + 13.87s + 34.91}
$$

**Continuous-time BJ model:** 

$$
y(t) = [B(s)/F(s)]u(t) + [C(s)/D(s)]e(t)
$$

- B(s) = 0.806622s + 0.6979
- C(s) = s³ + 323.6s² + 1.382e05s + 1.252e07
- D(s) = s³ + 204.5s² + 1.893e05s + 1.087e05
- F(s) = s² + 12.23s + 35.01

$$
\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{0.6979}{s² + 12.23s + 35.01}
$$

### SYSTEMS ROOT LOCUS PLOT
 This can be obtained by hand drawing as described in Various texts (Modern Control Theory Ogata (highly recommended reading in order to have an intuition of what is going on)), running a python script or a matlab script as below.

 **Continous-time Armax model**

 ```matlab
num_armax = [0.755];
den_armax = [1 13.87 34.91];
tf_t = tf( num_armax, den_armax)
pole(tf_t)
tf_t_closed = feedback( tf_t, 1)
pole(tf_t_closed)
rlocus( tf_t, 'b', tf_t_closed, 'r')
hold on
legend('sys','sys closed')
hold off
 ```

**Continous-time BJ model**

```matlab
num_BJ = [0.6979];
den_BJ = [1 12.23 35.01];
tf_BJ = tf( num_BJ, den_BJ)
pole(tf_BJ)
tf_BJ_closed = feedback( tf_BJ, 1)
pole(tf_BJ_closed)
rlocus(tf_BJ);rlocus( tf_BJ, 'b', tf_BJ_closed, 'r')
hold on
legend('sys','sys closed')
hold off
```

### WHAT DO THE DIAGRAMS TELL US






[^1]: Should I elaborate on the specific implications of root locus analysis for the current system under consideration? This could include how the poles move for our particular transfer function and what this means for the system's stability and performance as the gain changes.

# INTRODUCTION

This chapter presents the mathematical model of a DC motor. The fundamental law govering mechanical systems is Newton’s second law. The basic laws governing electrical circuits are Kirchhoff’s laws. For a detailed lesson go to Modern Control Engineering by K. Ogata Chapter 3.

## DC MOTOR POSITION: SYSTEM MODELING

A common actuator in control systems is the DC motor. It directly provides rotary motion and, coupled with wheels or drums and cables, can provide translational motion. The electric equivalent circuit of the armature and the free-body diagram of the rotor are shown in the following figure:

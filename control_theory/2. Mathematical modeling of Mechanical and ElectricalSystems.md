# INTRODUCTION

This chapter presents the mathematical model of a DC motor. The fundamental law govering mechanical systems is Newton’s second law. The basic laws governing electrical circuits are Kirchhoff’s laws. For a detailed lesson go to Modern Control Engineering by K. Ogata Chapter 3.

## DC MOTOR POSITION: SYSTEM MODELING

A common actuator in control systems is the DC motor. It directly provides rotary motion and, coupled with wheels or drums and cables, can provide translational motion. The electric equivalent circuit of the armature and the free-body diagram of the rotor are shown in the following figure:

### Components of the DC Motor Model

1. **Electrical Circuit:**
   - R: Armature resistance
   - L: Armature inductance
   - e: Back electromotive force (EMF)
   - V: Applied voltage

2. **Mechanical System:**
   - J: Moment of inertia of the rotor
   - b: Damping ratio of the mechanical system
   - θ: Angular position of rotor
   - T: Torque applied to the rotor

The mathematical model of the DC motor can be derived using these components and applying Kirchhoff's voltage law and Newton's second law of motion.

### DC Motor Equations

In a DC motor, the generated torque is typically proportional to both the armature current and the magnetic field strength. For our analysis, we'll assume a constant magnetic field, making the motor torque proportional only to the armature current $i$. This relationship is defined by the constant factor $K_t$, as shown in Equation 1. This setup is known as an armature-controlled motor.

(1) $$T = K_t i$$

The back electromotive force (EMF), $e$, is proportional to the shaft's angular velocity, with $K_b$ as the proportionality constant:

(2) $$ e = K_b \dot{\theta} $$

In SI units, $K_t = K_e$. We'll use $K$ to represent both constants.

Based on Newton's 2nd law and Kirchhoff's voltage law, we can derive the following governing equations:

(3) $$ J \ddot{\theta} + b \dot{\theta} = K i $$

(4) $$ L \frac{di}{dt} + Ri = V - K\dot{\theta} $$

Where:
- $J$: moment of inertia of the rotor
- $b$: motor viscous friction constant
- $L$: electric inductance
- $R$: electric resistance
- $V$: source voltage
- $\theta$: position of shaft

### Transfer Function

Applying the Laplace transform to equations (3) and (4):

(5) $$ s(Js + b)\Theta(s) = KI(s) $$

(6) $$ (Ls + R)I(s) = V(s) - Ks\Theta(s) $$

Eliminating $I(s)$ between these equations yields the open-loop transfer function, with rotational speed as output and armature voltage as input:

(7) $$ P(s) = \frac{\dot{\Theta}(s)}{V(s)} = \frac{K}{(Js + b)(Ls + R) + K^2} \quad [\frac{rad/sec}{V}] $$

For position as output, we integrate speed by dividing the above function by $s$:

(8) $$ \frac{\Theta(s)}{V(s)} = \frac{K}{s((Js + b)(Ls + R) + K^2)} \quad [\frac{rad}{V}] $$

### State-Space Representation

The differential equations derived earlier can also be expressed in state-space form. We choose the motor position, motor speed, and armature current as the state variables. The armature voltage is treated as the input, and the rotational position is chosen as the output.

The state-space equations are as follows:

(9) $$ \frac{d}{dt}\left[\begin{array}{c} 
\theta \\ 
\dot{\theta} \\ 
i 
\end{array} \right] =
\left [\begin{array}{ccc} 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & -\frac{b}{J} & \frac{K}{J} \\ 
0 & -\frac{K}{L} & -\frac{R}{L} 
\end{array} \right] 
\left [\begin{array}{c} 
\theta \\ 
\dot{\theta} \\ 
i 
\end{array} \right]  +
\left [\begin{array}{c} 
0 \\ 
0 \\ 
\frac{1}{L} 
\end{array} \right] V$$

(10) $$  y = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] 
\left [\begin{array}{c} 
\theta \\ 
\dot{\theta} \\ 
i
\end{array}\right] $$

Where:
- $\theta$ is the motor position
- $\dot{\theta}$ is the motor speed
- $i$ is the armature current
- $V$ is the armature voltage (input)
- $y$ is the output (rotational position)

This state-space model provides a compact representation of the DC motor system, allowing for easier analysis and control design using modern control theory techniques.

For our case since the parameters were not explicitly stated in the datasheet we had to use system identification to find discover them, this can be followed in our system identification documentation.
